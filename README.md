### **Search Deflector** is a small tool that redirects searches made from the Windows Start Menu or Cortana to whatever browser and search engine you prefer. No more Microsoft Edge and Bing!

Now you can search faster by just tapping the Windows key, and typing your search. Hit enter, or click one of the results in the right panel. This is faster than opening your browser (if it isn't already), opening a new tab, and clicking the search bar. I've found it to be a good quality-of-life trick.

**Please don't forget to star this repository** if you like what I've made!

After a simple setup, you can use *any* browser (provided it is registered as a protocol handler) and *any* search engine. If you are having trouble getting either of these to work, send me an email at support@spikespaz.com or create an [issue](https://github.com/spikespaz/search-deflector/issues), and I will see what I can do to get your custom settings working.

### Doesn't this already exist?

Yes, I know. [EdgeDeflector](https://github.com/da2x/EdgeDeflector) and [SearchWithMyBrowser](https://github.com/sylveon/SearchWithMyBrowser).

I had been using EdgeDeflector for quite some time, but it had some issues. It was buggy, sometimes it doesn't transform the URIs properly. It also doesn't allow you to change the search engine, and it only uses your system default browser.

SearchWithMyBrowser has the same problems as EdgeDeflector.

# How do I set it up?

Download the latest installer executable by clicking [here](https://spikespaz.com/tools/repo-dl/?user=spikespaz&repo=search-deflector&file=SearchDeflector-Installer.exe) and follow the prompts.

Take a look at the [Wiki page](https://github.com/spikespaz/search-deflector/wiki/Setup-&-Installing) if you're having trouble or need more information.

# I found a bug / it doesn't work!

First, look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/spikespaz/search-deflector/wiki/Troubleshooting) for help. If that still doesn't fix your problem, submit a new [issue](https://github.com/spikespaz/search-deflector/issues) describing the problem with as much detail as possible.

# Donations

If you would like to show appreciation for my work, I would gladly accept a small donation!

I am the sole author of this project, and if you appreciate my work or any of my other projects, you can donate a small amount to help me out.

Even if you don't want to donate, I would hugely appreciate a star on the repository so the visibility goes up and I get that dopamine rush. Seeing people use the software I've worked hard on makes me happy.

I will accept donations through PayPal.Me, Buy Me a Coffee, or Patreon.

# Special thanks

All of the very first users of this project deserve callouts for putting up with me and the bugs I've made.

Even though I've basically usurped their projects, @da2x and @sylveon for the inspiration.
